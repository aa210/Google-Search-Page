Replication of Google Search Results
<p>Recreated a Google Search results page incorporating one of my favorite topics: FASHION! {HELLEW!?} :-D
<p>I'm happy with everything for the most part. The only issue was replicating the pagination at the bottom of the page. 
<p>Again, this was a project I completed to get more comfortable writing HTML and CSS code.
